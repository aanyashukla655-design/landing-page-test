# Simple Landing Page (Internship Test Project)

Hey!  
This is a small landing page I made for a web dev internship test.  
The idea was to take a few sections from the provided Figma design and turn them into
a responsive page using only **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JS** (no frameworks).

I picked 6 sections that I felt made sense together:
- Navbar  
- Hero  
- Features  
- About  
- Testimonials  
- Footer  

I tried to keep the code simple and readable instead of over-engineering it.  
Everything is built from scratch (no Bootstrap, Tailwind, etc.)

## ✨ Features / What I Did
- Fully responsive layout (works on phone + laptop)
- Mobile navbar toggle (just plain JavaScript)
- Simple grid layout for features & testimonials
- Used free placeholder images because the design didn’t include actual assets
- Clean(ish) structure without being too “robot perfect”

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  
- **Vanilla JavaScript**  
- No libraries, no frameworks
